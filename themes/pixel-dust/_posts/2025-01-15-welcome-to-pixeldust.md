# Welcome to PixelDust!

This is your first blog post with the PixelDust theme. Replace this content with your own introduction post.

## What is PixelDust?

PixelDust is a retro pixel art theme designed specifically for artists and game developers who want to showcase their work in a nostalgic, pixel-perfect environment.

## Getting Started

To customize this theme for your needs:

1. **Update Site Information**: Edit the `_config.yml` file with your information

3. **Customize Colors**: Modify the color scheme in the SCSS files
4. **Add Your Portfolio**: Create portfolio items in the `_portfolio` collection
5. **Share Your Games**: Add your games to the `_games` collection

## Pixel Art Tips

Here are some quick tips for creating great pixel art:

- **Start Small**: Begin with small canvases (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)
- **Use Limited Colors**: Restrict your color palette for consistency
- **Pixel Perfect**: Ensure crisp edges and avoid anti-aliasing
- **Study References**: Look at classic pixel art games for inspiration
- **Practice Animations**: Start with simple walk cycles and basic movements

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how to create a sprite in your favorite game engine:

```javascript
// Example sprite creation
class PixelSprite {
  constructor(x, y, width, height) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.image = new Image();
  }
  
  load(src) {
    this.image.src = src;
  }
  
  draw(ctx) {
    ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false; // Pixel perfect rendering
    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
  }
}
```
