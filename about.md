# About VampireTonic

VampireTonic is a Jekyll theme that embraces the dark, gothic aesthetic inspired by vampire mythology and gothic literature. Created for those who appreciate the beauty found in shadows and the elegance of the macabre.

## Design Philosophy

Our design philosophy centers around:

- **Elegance in Darkness**: Beauty doesn't always need bright colors
- **Gothic Sophistication**: Classic elements with modern functionality  
- **Atmospheric Experience**: Every element contributes to the mood
- **Timeless Appeal**: A design that won't fade with trends

## Color Palette

The theme uses a carefully curated palette:

- **Deep Crimson (#8B0000)**: The primary color, representing passion and vitality
- **Dark Brown (#2F1B14)**: Rich earth tones for depth and warmth
- **Crimson Accent (#DC143C)**: Brighter red for highlights and calls-to-action
- **Near Black (#0D0D0D)**: The canvas of darkness
- **Light Gray (#E8E8E8)**: For readable text that doesn't strain the eyes

## Typography

We use two beautiful font families:

- **Cinzel**: A serif font for headings that evokes carved stone and ancient manuscripts
- **Crimson Text**: A readable serif for body text that maintains the gothic feel
